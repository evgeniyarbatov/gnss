    "description": "Observations of GNSS Satellites. Raw data is collected with GnssLogger App. NORAD Catalog Numbers are matched based on azimuth and elevation calculated from TLE files for each satellite. TLE files from https://www.space-track.org. NORAD CAT IDs from http://celestrak.org.\n\nI was interested in mapping [satellite IDs from Android GNSS APIs](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/GnssMeasurement#getSvid()) to NORAD IDs. If NORAD IDs are known, we can predict which satellites are visible without having to collect the raw data. This is useful for understanding location accuracy.\n\nThe dataset is limited to GNSS satellites I have seen from my location. Source code on [Github](https://github.com/evgeniyarbatov/gnss)",
